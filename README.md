mIRC
====
Contains scripts for a bot account on twitch.tv. 
Has commands to periodically read lines of text from a specified file to a stream chat. 
It can also perform the action on command as well as add new lines of text to the file.

Put the remote.txt inside your scripts folder, which is inside your mIRC folder. Have your bot log into the mIRC client and then connect to a channel to start.
